# MSE Capstone 2021 - Embedded Motor Performance Enhancement System

This project is for an Embedded Smart Motor Performance Enhancement System.

The overall objective of this system is to compensate for the nonlinearities typically found in DC motors at low duty cycles. 

## Libraries Required:
[CustomPWM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kZl4b6dBvbuqZpM3YXR_VyvR6hqdwDXl/view?usp=sharing)
An open source custom PWM library to adjust PWM frequencies to specific values in real time.
